nntp-client
======

A .NET Core compatible implementation of the NNTP protocol that can be used
to create an NNTP newsgroup reader client.  This repository features a
classlib which can be referenced, and a small example console application
that demonstrates its ability to connect to an NNTP server and operate as a
client.

This client project grew out of NNTP-related interests in the McNNTP
repository.

To keep this library purely a .NET Core offering, I have copied some of the
DotNetZip library files for Zlib into this project.  For this reason, this
project is licensed under MS-PL.

Pull requests or questions are welcome!
