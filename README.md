nntp-client
======

A .NET Core implementation of the NNTP protocol that can be used to create an
NNTP newsgroup reader client.  This repository features a classlib which can
be referenced, and a small example console application that demonstrates
its ability to connect to an NTTP server and operate as a client.

This client project grew out of NNTP-related interests in the McNNTP
repository.

To keep this library purely a .NET Core offering, I have copied some of the
DotNetZip library files for Zlib into this project.  For this reason, this
project is licensed under MS-PL.
